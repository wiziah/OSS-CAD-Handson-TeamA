# Azure Mobile Center

Azure Mobile Center has been used for building the app, distributing beta copies of the app, and for analyzing crashes and usage statistics for the app.
 
# 1. To view the build process for the app:

Login to http://mobile.azure.com and navigate to the Gallery3.Android app, and finally to the "Build" tab.  Click on the "master" branch build entry to view previous builds of the master branch.  You can click on each build to see the detailed results of each build, or click the spanner icon in the top right hand corner of the screen to view the settings for the build process.  Note the "Build frequency" setting for continuous integration, "Test on a real device" indicating the testing capabilities Azure Mobile Center has, and finally "Distribute builds".
